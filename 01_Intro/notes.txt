Typescript is all about 'TYPE SAFETY'.

It offers STATIC CHECKING. (Ananlyze the code as we type.)

TS           ------------------------------------> JS
It's a developmen tool. The project still runs JS.

Types: number string boolean
        null undefined void
        object array tuples
        any never unknown

Syntax: let variableName: type = value;
-> no type means 'any'
-> 'any' is not type checked.
